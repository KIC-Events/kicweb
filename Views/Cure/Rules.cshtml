            <p>For check-in purposes at the event, attendee lists are generated based on who purchased a ticket.

If you do decide to take pictures in your hotel room and post them to Fet, or possibly other social media, you must ensure that there are no identifying features of the room that will allow others who see the pictures know the location of the host hotel.

            <p>No. We have seen many cool pictures over the years of people being tied to a luggage cart, though that is not what they are intended for. As people who travel often, we have seen more than our fair share of luggage carts that we would be scared as hell to tie anyone to. We also want to make sure that people who need luggage carts to take their luggage in and out have fair and equal access to them. It really sucks when you are on the higher floors, and you have to take multiple trips up and down because there isn't a luggage cart handy anywhere.</p>
            <p>Along the same lines of luggage carts, you cannot tie people to railings on stairwells or other things that look like a cool or interesting hard point. Besides any possible safety issues, anyone who may be at the hotel who is not an attendee (hotel staff/other guests) did not consent to walking into a situation where they would come across something like that. As much as we want and request people to respect our boundaries and consent, we must ensure we do that for others as well.</p>

        KIC Events is committed to being an inclusive, safe, welcoming and positive space for all alternative lifestyles to express themselves in their kink, gender orientation, sexuality, and relationships as is their preference. The entire event is classified as pansexual and “all gender friendly”. Please respect everyone’s gender self-identification. If you are not sure about how someone prefers to be referred to, ask politely.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly believe in the “Law of Mobility” and “Your kink may not be my kink, AND that is OK”. If you see something you do not like, simply remove yourself from that area. Be respectful and courteous to their space by keeping comments to yourself, as you would want to be done to you and your space. We ask that everyone keep an open, non-judgmental mind, try things, learn what you can, and expand your mind to new possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        At CURE, we are committed to fostering an <b>inclusive, safe, and welcoming</b> space where all individuals—regardless of kink, gender identity, sexual orientation, or relationship structure—can freely express themselves.

        Respect &amp; Inclusivity

      <p>
        All-Gender & Pansexual-Friendly Space: Our entire event is classified as pansexual and all-gender friendly. We ask that all attendees respect each person’s self-identification and pronouns. If you are unsure, ask politely rather than assume.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Kink May Not Be My Kink, and That’s OK: We strongly believe in the Law of Mobility—if you see something that is not for you, simply remove yourself from the area. Do not disrupt others or make unsolicited comments about their scene, as you would expect the same courtesy for your own preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open-Minded Exploration: We encourage attendees to approach the event with curiosity and respect. Try new things, learn from others, and expand your understanding of the many diverse expressions of kink and alternative lifestyles.

      CURE 2026 Transfer &amp; Refund Policy
    </h2>
    <div class="content bod-text">
      <p class="h5">
        Ticket Transfers
      </p>
      <p>
        Tickets purchased for the CURE 2026 event are <b>non-transferable</b> under any circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        All registered attendees are required to undergo a background check at the time of ticket purchase. For this reason, transferring a ticket to another individual is not permitted, as it would bypass the required security screening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Event check-in procedures rely on attendee lists generated from the names of original ticket purchasers. Individuals whose names do not appear on the attendee list will be denied entry, regardless of possession of a ticket. This policy is strictly enforced to ensure the safety and security of all participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, in the event of a sellout, a waiting list may be established. Unauthorized ticket transfers circumvent the fair and orderly process of this waitlist and will not be honored.
      </p>
      <p class="h5">
        Ticket Refunds
      </p>
      <p>
        Ticket holders may request a refund according to the schedule outlined below. All refunds are subject to a <b>$10 processing fee</b> to cover administrative and transaction costs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>100% Refund</b> (minus processing fee): Requests made on or before <b>October 3, 2025</b></li>
        <li><b>75% Refund</b> (minus processing fee): Requests made between <b>October 4 and October 31, 2025</b></li>
        <li><b>50% Refund</b> (minus processing fee): Requests made between <b>November 1 and November 28, 2025</b></li>
        <li><b>No Refunds:</b> Requests made on or after <b>November 29, 2025</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All refund requests must be submitted in writing via email to <a href="mailto:admin@kicevents.com">admin@kicevents.com.</a>

      <p class="h5">
        On-Site Policy
      </p>
      <p>
        No one will be permitted to enter the CURE 2026 Event Space without advance registration.

      KIC Cell Phone Use Policy
    </h2>
    <div class="content bod-text">
      <p>
        We recognize that cell phones are a part of daily life—but in kink spaces, their presence comes with added responsibility. There is no way to fully eliminate the risks associated with cell phone use in public or private event spaces, so we ask all attendees to evaluate their personal boundaries and risk tolerance before attending.
      </p>
      <p>
        This KIC Cell Phone Use Policy is part of our ongoing effort to create a space where we can all engage more safely and intentionally. Just like many forms of kink, cell phone use in these environments carries risks—but with clear expectations and mutual respect, we can navigate it together. Be mindful of others’ privacy, and when in doubt, ask first.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>NO cell phones</b> allowed in the main event space at any time.</li>
        <li>Cell phone use to designated areas only. Please step outside the event space to make calls.</li>
        <li>Designated areas for cellphone usage in the event space are: the Restaurant, Game Cubby, and Vendor Area.</li>
        <li>Photography is strictly prohibited in ALL event spaces. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cell phone use for a medical condition, please see our <a href="#disability-policy-title">Disability Accommodation Policy.</a>

      KIC Events Disability Accommodation Policy
    </h2>
    <div class="content bod-text">
      <p>
        At KIC Events, we are committed to fostering an inclusive, accessible, and welcoming environment for all attendees. We recognize that individuals with disabilities may require accommodations, including the use of personal devices to monitor health conditions, navigate spaces, or assist with communication.  In accordance with the ADA, we provide Reasonable Accommodations (RA) for those who require them.
      </p>
      <p class="h5">
        Use of Phones & Electronic Devices for Accessibility
      </p>
      <p>
        While our event maintains a no-electronic devices/phones policy in event spaces to protect privacy and create a distraction-free environment, we fully acknowledge that some attendees rely on their phones or other electronic devices as medical or accessibility tools. Devices used for these purposes are exempt from the no-phone policy when required for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitoring health conditions (e.g., blood glucose monitors, heart rate monitors, seizure alert systems)</li>
        <li>Communication assistance (e.g., speech-to-text apps, AAC devices)</li>
        <li>Navigation and mobility support (e.g., screen readers, GPS, visual or auditory aids)</li>
        <li>Other disability-related needs as required by the attendee</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="h5">
        Requesting an Accommodation
      </p>
      <p>
        In accordance with the ADA, we provide Reasonable Accommodations (RA) for those who require them.  If you require the use of a phone or other device in the event space for disability-related reasons, you do not need to disclose specific medical details, but we ask that you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inform event staff or a designated Accessibility Coordinator upon arrival or at check-in.</li>
        <li>A RA Sticker will be received by attendees to place on their event badge.</li>
        <li>Ensure that usage is discreet and solely for accessibility purposes.</li>
        <li>Use vibrate/silent mode to minimize disruption.</li>
        <li>Videos and photos are not allowed to maintain event and attendee privacy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="h5">
        Additional Accommodations
      </p>
      <p>
        We strive to accommodate additional accessibility needs, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reserved seating for those with mobility limitations</li>
        <li>Sensory-friendly areas or quiet spaces</li>
        <li>Alternative formats for event materials (e.g., large print, digital copies)</li>
        <li>Accessibility routes for wheelchairs and mobility devices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
