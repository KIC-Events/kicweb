            <p>No. The reason the answer is no, is because a background check is completed on everyone who purchased a ticket. If you give your ticket to someone else, we will not have completed a background check on the person the ticket was transferred to.</p>
            <p>For check-in purposes at the event, attendee lists are generated based on who purchased a ticket. If your friend showed up at the event after you bought a ticket, they would be turned away at registration as their name would not be on the list. This is intended to help maintain the overall safety and security of the event</p>
            <p>t is also possible that there will be a waiting list for tickets if the event is a sellout. By transferring a ticket from you to someone else, that is akin to cutting in line which would be unfair to others.</p>

            <p>If you are caught with your cellphone out in event space, MOD's or event leaders will ask to see your phone to verify that no pictures, videos, or other recordings were taken without consent.

            <p>That is allowed though there are some caveats to it. If you do decide to take pictures in your hotel room and post them to Fet, or possibly other social media, you must ensure that there are no identifying features of the room that will allow others who see the pictures know the location of the host hotel. Various hotel chains have branding when it comes to the carpet, furniture, and other design elements which can make it easy to identify the location of the host hotel.</p>

            <p>No. We have seen many cool pictures over the years of people being tied to a luggage cart, though that is not what they are intended for. As people who travel often, we have seen more than our fair share of luggage carts that we would be scared as hell to tie anyone to. We also want to make sure that people who need luggage carts to take their luggage in and out have fair and equal access to them. It really sucks when you are on the higher floors, and you have to take multiple trips up and down because there isn't a luggage cart handy anywhere.</p>
            <p>Along the same lines of luggage carts, you cannot tie people to railings on stairwells or other things that look like a cool or interesting hard point. Besides any possible safety issues, anyone who may be at the hotel who is not an attendee (hotel staff/other guests) did not consent to walking into a situation where they would come across something like that. As much as we want and request people to respect our boundaries and consent, we must ensure we do that for others as well.</p>
