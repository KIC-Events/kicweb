      <p>
        Our events wouldn’t be possible without the support of our amazing volunteers. From helping things run behind the scenes to welcoming attendees and maintaining safe spaces, <b>volunteering is a powerful way to be part of the heart of CURE.</b>
      </p>     
      <p>
        Whether you’ve volunteered dozens of times or this would be your first—<b>you’re welcome here.</b> Every volunteer will receive clear role descriptions, and an opportunity for pre-event training so you feel confident and prepared in your position.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a fantastic opportunity to get involved beyond just attending. Columbus is full of folks who love to show up for community, and we have a wide variety of roles available so you can show up in a way that fits you.

    <div class="content body-text">
      <h3>CREDENTIAL CHECKER:</h3>
      <p>
        Posted at access points throughout the hotel and entrance to event areas, Credential Checkers ensure only registered attendees, with wristbands and badges, are permitted entry into designated spaces. This is a seated position with lots of friendly interaction and an important piece in keeping our event safe.      </p>
      <h3>DUNGEON MONITOR:</h3>
      <p>
        DMs will rotate through the event play spaces, observing activities, listening for safewords, and ensuring that all play and equipment remains safe, consensual, and within event guidelines. You’ll also help ensure equipment is cleaned between scenes and keep track of scene lengths (40-minute max).
      </p>
      <h3>SHIFTING</h3>
      <p>
        This hands-on role involves moving chairs and furniture between classes, opening/closing ceremonies, and the play parties. It also includes help with event setup and tear-down. Great for those who like to be active and behind the scenes.
