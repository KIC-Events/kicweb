### CI/CD Plan  
#### Main branch should be forked and merged to only for necessary hotfixes.  
#### Dev branch will be pushed to production server monthly on the first Friday.
#### Dev branch should be forked for all feature updates and non-critical bugfixes  
#### Any changes made directly to main branch will trigger an automatic downmerge to dev, if you need a clean copy of dev without this downmerge, branch from dev before pushing to main
